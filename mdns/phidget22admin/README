============

    ./configure; make; make install

Requirements
============

    libphidget22
    libphidget22extra

Usage
=====

    phidget22admin [options]...

 Options:

  -A            Set password for the server specified by -H. The password
                will be prompted - it is not specified as an argument. This
                allows connections to Phidget Network Servers that have a
                password set.

  -F path       Set path of firmware upgrade files. By default, the tool
                looks for a 'firmware' directory in the current directory,
                and if not found looks for installed firmware (on Linux)
                in the standard install path (/usr/share/phidget22admin/).

  -H srvname    Filter by server name. This will filter results to a single
                Network Server. This is required when using -o, -c or -k,
                or upgrading firmware on a remote Phidget.

  -L            Include local devices when listing devices with -d. If
                neither -L nor -R are specified, both default to true.

  -M sn[/hp/ch] Filter by serial number / hub port / channel. This is used
                to filter the output of -d, or to select a device for firmware
                upgrade. '-M 1234' will show devices with the serial number
                '1234', '-M 1234/2' will show VINT devices connected to port
                2 of a VINT hub with serial number '1234', '-M 1234//0' will
                show all channel 0 connected to serial number '1234', etc..

  -R            Include remote devices when listing devices with -d. If
                neither -L nor -R are specified, both default to true.

  -U            Perform a firmware upgrade. This requires that a unique
                device is specified with -M. To upgrade a remote device, -H
                must be specified as well. To perform a major version upgrade,
                specify -m; otherwise a minor upgrade will be performed.
                Firmware is upgraded to the newest available (major or minor)
                version that is newer than the installed version, unless
                the version is overriden with -V.

  -m            Allow major firmware upgrades of 100+. Major upgrades can
                break compatibility with existing software and so are
                explicitely opt-in.

  -V version    Specify firmware version for upgrade. This can be used to
                install a particular firmware version - by default, the
                newest firmware version is installed.

  -a            List ALL devices which support firmware upgrade - by default
                only devices with a newer firmware version available are
                listed. This option requires -d and -u.

  -c            List open channels on server specified by -H. This displays
                a list of channels that the specified server has open, along
                with which clients are accessing them.

  -d            List Phidget devices and their channels. This is filtered by
                -M, -H, -L, -R. If -u is specified, this displays devices
                which can be firmware upgraded, along with available firmware
                versions.

  -k key[=val]  Print or set a key, on the control dictionary, on the server
                specified by -H. This could be used to change the log level on
                a running Network server, to read out the open connections
                json string, etc.

  -l            Enable phidget22 logging. Logs are written to
                'phidget22admin.log' in the current directory. -l can be
                specified multiple times to increase the logging verbosity.

  -o            List open connections on server specified by -H. This displays
                a list of all clients connected to a server.
  
  -q            Quiet output. This is used to make the firmware upgrade list
                easier to parse.

  -s            List Phidget Network Servers and Network Phidgets such as the
                PhidgetSBC and HUB5000.

  -u            Modify -d to display devices which support firmware upgrade
                instead of displaying devices and channels. This also lists
                the installed and available firmware version for each device.
                By default, only devices with a newer firmware available are
                shown. Specify -a to also list devices that are up to date.

  -v            Verbose output. This displays extra information for servers
                listed by -s

  -w seconds    Time to wait for devices and/or servers before proceeding to
                list devices, list servers, upgrade firmware, etc.. This
                defaults to 3 seconds. On a busy or slow network, increasing
                the delay may discover more servers/devices.
